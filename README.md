# advml_mnist_subs

Final project for CSE 891: Adversarial Machine Learning

[Final paper](891_AA_with_FashionMNIST.pdf)

## Stages of accomplishment
1. Evaluate existing model (if available) on MNIST and compare to empirical paper results
2. Plug in Fashion-MNIST and train a new Pytorch model using given code
3. Evaluate new model using IDENTICAL procedure as step 1
4. OPTIONALLY repeat 2/3 using Kuzushiji-MNIST (cursive Japanese) - Not enough time


## Commands to train models
add time in front when running on Azure to see timing
    NO NEED, creating an experiment shows run time and many more useful stats like output logs

$ python train_trades_mnist.py
$ python train_trades_fashion_mnist.py

$ python train.py --config config/mnist_crown.json
$ python train.py --config config/fashion_mnist_crown_ibp.json
